Minor Project: Netflix Login Page Using HTML and CSS

This project involves creating a replica of the Netflix login page using only HTML and CSS. It is a front-end development project aimed at beginners who want to enhance their skills in web design and layout structuring. The goal of this project is to understand how to build aesthetically pleasing and responsive user interfaces using fundamental web technologies.

The login page features a clean and modern design that mimics Netflixâ€™s real login interface. The HTML portion of the project provides the structure of the page, including form elements such as input fields for email and password, a "Sign In" button, a "Remember me" checkbox, and links for "Need help?" and "Sign up now." The form is wrapped within a centered container on a dark-themed background to give it a professional look.

The CSS handles the styling of the page. Flexbox is used to center the login box both vertically and horizontally. Custom styles are applied to input fields and buttons to match Netflixâ€™s branding. Hover effects and transition animations are also included to enhance user interaction.

This project demonstrates the use of semantic HTML tags, CSS layout techniques, responsiveness, and basic form handling design. While it doesn't include any back-end functionality, it is an excellent example of how front-end elements are styled and structured to create a real-world web page. This Netflix login clone is ideal for portfolio showcasing or as a starting point for more complex web development projects.
